# ToDoList
A simple todo list, a good way to practice CRUD in JS. Can create, edit, and delete tasks, also uses localStorage to save the data in Local Storage. 

Nothing fancy. You can remove the id functionality within the code, since I am not really using it in any meaninful way (was originally added to add the functionality of editing and deleting items but I ended up doing it in different way).
